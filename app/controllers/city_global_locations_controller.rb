    # I want pagination... So Replaced following line with CityGlobalLocation.paginate ...
    #@city_global_locations = CityGlobalLocation.find(:all)
    # ...
    # So used http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wikis as suggested by AWDWR_3rd_Ed Page 526.
    # ...    
    #As of Rails 2.0, pagination is no longer a part of Rails, instead this functionality
    #is provided by a gem. You can add this gem to an existing application by adding
    #the following to the end of conﬁg/environment.rb.
    #Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    #  config.gem 'mislav-will_paginate' , :version => '~> 2.3.2' ,
    #    :lib => 'will_paginate' , :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
    #end
    # ...
    #Added by Hani Elabed on 12-31-2008 
    # Then, to install this gem (and any other missing gem dependencies), run
    # sudo rake gems:install
    # ...
    #Then added following block to the bottom of views/city_global_locations/index.html.erb
    #
    #<hr/>
    # <%= will_paginate @city_global_locations %>
    #<hr/>
